/// Provides storage for handlers.
/**
 * The handler_storage class provides the storage for handlers:
 * http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/Handler.html   
 * It supports Boost.Asio custom memory allocation: 
 * http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/core/allocation.html
 *
 * A value h of a stored handler class should work correctly 
 * in the expression h(arg) where arg is an lvalue of type const Arg.
 *
 * Stored handler must have nothrow copy-constructor. 
 * This restriction is predicted by asio custom memory allocation.
 *
 * Every instance of handler_storage class is tied to 
 * some instance of boost::asio::io_service class.
 *
 * The stored handler can't be invoked (and must not be invoked) directly.
 * It can be only destroyed or posted (with immediate stored value 
 * destruction) to the io_service object to which the handler_storage object 
 * is tied by usage of boost::asio::io_service::post method.
 *
 * The handler_storage class instances are automatically cleaned up
 * during destruction of the tied io_service (those handler_storage class 
 * instances that are alive to that moment).
 * That clean up is done by destruction of the stored value (handler) - 
 * not the handler_storage instance itself.   
 * Because of the automatic clean up, users of handler_storage must remember
 * that the stored value (handler) may be destroyed without explicit
 * user activity. Also this implies to the thread safety.
 * The handler_storage instances must not outlive the tied io_service object.
 * A handler_storage object can store a value (handler) that is 
 * the owner of the handler_storage object itself.
 * This is one of the reasons of automatic clean up.
 *
 * handler_storage is like boost::function, except:
 * 
 * @li boost::function is more flexible and general,
 * @li handler_storage supports Boost.Asio custom memory allocation,
 * @li handler_storage is automatically cleaned up during 
 * io_service destruction,
 * @li handler_storage is noncopyable.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
 *   
 * Attention! 
 * Because of the speed decisions no additional run-time checks are done in
 * release version.
